    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This SOP seeks to provide clear guidelines and expectations on the SSA LOB with focus on the Live Resolution function of SSAs</p>

    <h2>2. Stakeholders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vendor Management Team</strong></li>
        <li><strong>TaskUs & Telus:</strong>
            <ul>

    <h2>3. The Process - High Level View</h2>

    <h3>3.1 SA PoV:</h3>
     <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OR8TThnUp42FzcveuL5TY3VlsrVuvwOd/view?usp=sharing">üìã Open SA work flow final document</a></p>

  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfDGMSd7jqS94C0BTrMyWx_EEdi3AQHz/view?usp=sharing">üìã Open SSA Support flow final document</a></p>

    <h3>3.3 SSA Tooling:</h3>
    <p>The main tools used for Live resolutions is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beacon</strong></li>
        <li><strong>SSA Skilling on Beacon:</strong> SSA Consulting Chats</li>
        <li><strong>Configured Concurrency expectation:</strong> 3 chats at all times</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. SSA Support Process</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Step by step process:</h3>
    <div class="process-step">
        <p><strong>At the start of your Live Assistance shift, you must log into Beacon:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <code>https://beacon.shopify.io/</code>.</li>
            <li>While your status is Offline, click on Settings.</li>
            <li>Set your Skill tag to SSA Consulting Chat. This ensures that you're offered chats from Advisors.</li>
            <li>In the General section, set Max chats to 3.</li>
            <li>Change your status to Chats.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> For SSAs, this will pull Advisor/Specialist chats. For Advisors/Specialists, the Chats status will pull merchant chats.
    </div>

    <p><strong>The Beacon window for SSAs is divided into 2 sections: Account and Monitor chat tabs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account:</strong> Situated on the left, this tab shares the merchant's account information and links to their Storefront, Admin, and Internal. This layout is identical to what Advisors/Specialists see in their interface. This allows you to quickly reference key details and navigate to critical areas of the merchant's account proactively.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor chat:</strong> Situated on the right, this section gives you real-time insights into the live interaction and context between the Advisor and the merchant. Although only the Advisor can directly interact with the merchant, having access to this ongoing dialogue equips you with crucial, up-to-date context, enabling faster resolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Chat window:</strong> You'll see Advisor request details populate here in the form of a chat. The Advisors'/Specialists' completed form and all context they've provided are shown above the chat. In this space, you'll be able to communicate directly and efficiently with the Advisor so you can collaborate to resolve the issue.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Until an Advisor needs support, this space is blank.
    </div>

    <h3>4.2 SSA Best Practices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interaction concurrency:</strong> As you would in Slack, maintain a 3-chat concurrency while working in Beacon.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on the issue at hand:</strong> Once the issue is resolved, end the chat with the Advisor. Refrain from hand-holding or over-supporting beyond the parameters of the request. Advisors/Specialists must submit a fresh Request help form if additional issues arise.</li>
        <li><strong>Ending interactions:</strong> To ensure Advisor/Specialist chats with SSAs aren't closed prematurely, only SSAs have the ability to end an interaction with the Advisor.</li>
        <li><strong>Stale interactions:</strong> Follow the 7-minute step-away process, with check-ins at the 2-, 5-, and 7-minute marks before ending the chat with the Advisor.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="review">
        Review the Channel Expectations - Stale Interactions - Guru Card.
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rules of engagement:</strong> These remain the same as in Slack for all SSAs.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind downs:</strong> While working in Beacon, begin to wind down no earlier than 15 minutes before the end of your scheduled block.</li>
        <li><strong>Live Assistance transcripts and notes:</strong> When an interaction between an SSA and Advisor is complete, that transcript and your Internal Notes are saved within the related Zendesk ticket as an Internal Note.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 SSA Wrap Up process:</h3>
    <p>Once you've wrapped up supporting the Advisor, select the pencil icon on the bottom left-hand corner of your chat window to complete the SSA Internal Notes. The following fields should be completed in full:</p>

    <h4>Collaboration outcome:</h4>
    <p>Dropdown options to measure necessity of the request: Was the reach out valid/necessary?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acceptable Collaboration:</strong> The collaboration was needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration Not Required:</strong> The interaction could've been solved without SSA involvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Dropped/Disconnected Interaction:</strong> When a chat gets dropped due to connectivity/tooling issues, or the chat between the Advisor and merchant disconnects and therefore the SSA chat has closed automatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Reason collaboration wasn't required:</h4>
    <p>Dropdown only appears when Collaboration outcome > Collaboration Not Required is selected above:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resources Available:</strong> There is a resource available and accessible that would have resolved the issue without collaboration.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect team:</strong> Collaboration was directed to SSAs incorrectly. It should have gone directly to a different escalated team or channel.</li>
        <li><strong>Out of scope:</strong> This issue isn't supportable by the SSA team or another escalated team, such as third-party issues not within an escalated teams' scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Already Escalated:</strong> A ticket(s) have already been escalated to the correct team for resolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Collaboration quality:</h4>
    <p>Dropdown options to measure the quality of the Advisor's submission and troubleshooting steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acceptable Quality:</strong> The collaboration request met the expected standards, providing clear and sufficient context.</li>
        <li><strong>Workflow Incomplete:</strong> Collaboration macro/workflow lacks complete and/or accurate information.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting Incomplete:</strong> Expected troubleshooting steps weren't performed before seeking SSA support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Resolution resource quality:</h4>
    <p>Dropdown options to measure the quality of the resource used to solve the request.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource Accurate:</strong> The relevant resource(s) provided clear and comprehensive information that addresses the issue effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Unclear:</strong> The relevant resource(s) contain ambiguous or confusing information making it difficult to effectively resolve the issue, and/or was too long or difficult to find/navigate.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Unavailable:</strong> There's no existing resource(s) available that addresses the issue at hand.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource URL:</strong> Mandatory textbox to gather the URL(s) of the resource(s) being referred to in the Resolution Resource field.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Textbox for any other relevant notes or context that wouldn't be linked by the Advisor. For example: outlining specific info that would be relevant to the TMS escalation the Advisor will be submitting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.4. SSA Scope:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SSAs are expected to support with queries from Core advisors teams via Beacon for chats and via #bpo-supportline for async interactions</li>
        <li>Plus/Retail are supported are currently out of scope for support</li>
        <li>Both TaskUs and Telus Advisors will be supported by TaskUs SSAs for all topics except the below.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <p><strong>Billing & Payments and Shopify Academy requests will automatically route to Internal SSAs until further notice.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>BPO Advisors must seek support from internal SSAs in #support-ssa on the following requests only, until further notice:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting draft domain statuses in OpenSRS.</li>
            <li>Changing IPS Tags for .co.uk domains when transferring them out of Shopify.</li>
            <li>Merchant exemption requests for new variant upload limit.</li>
            <li>Setting authentication codes for some TLDs such as .DE domains.</li>
            <li>Request from app developers to transfer ownership of apps to another partner account.</li>
            <li>Accessing the Collab admin to see if automatic payments are enabled.</li>
            <li>Accessing the Business Platform Internal to update the organization name displayed in the Admin and adding/removing shops from identity/store switcher.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>For async interactions, TaskUs and Telus Advisors will use #bpo-supportline.</p>
