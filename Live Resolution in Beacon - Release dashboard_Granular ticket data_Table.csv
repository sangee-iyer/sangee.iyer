"Jun 6, 2025",57999466,Core,General,Inventory and Transfers,"Details:
Merchant (John Payne) has been facing a technical issue with enabling multi-location inventory tracking for existing products in their store, The Bookmonger. Specifically:

Store Info: The Bookmonger (thebookmongerbearsden.co.uk)

Locations: Gardners and The Bookmonger

Issue:

New products allow multi-location inventory tracking, but existing products do not.

Example product: The Spider Covenant (Product ID: 10470900203854).

When exporting inventory, the second location appears (Bookmonger) but with a ""not stocked"" status.

Adjusting the stock level to ""0"" doesn't enable inventory tracking for the second location.

Merchant cannot select multiple locations from the product settings UI, despite the locations showing up in the exported data.

Merchant needs the ability to track the same product at both locations (Gardners and Bookmonger) with separate inventory counts.

Expected Outcome: Be able to have separate inventory tracking for the same product at different locations, not just moving stock between locations.

Current Issue: The existing products are not reflecting the multi-location option in the inventory interface.

Additional Information:

Merchant has already ensured that both locations are set up correctly in the store settings.

The UI for editing multiple locations is not showing up for existing products.

The stock changes made in the export file (e.g., changing ""not stocked"" to ""0"") are not syncing properly.

Request:
Please assist with diagnosing the issue and enabling multi-location inventory for these existing products, particularly ensuring that both locations (Gardners and Bookmonger) can track inventory separately for the same product.",Vansh Gaba,TaskUs India Geo Lead Geo Lead,Outsourced Employees (TaskUs),Juan Chaquea,TaskUs Cali Geo Lead,Outsourced Employees (TaskUs),54,resolved live,44,220.25,false,false

**Hi there!**

I’m reaching out on behalf of a merchant who is currently experiencing an issue with the **sales and compare-at prices** on two of their products.

1. **Green Inhaler**:

   * It was set up with a **compare-at price of 129** and a **sale price of 99**, but it’s showing **379** instead of the correct pricing on the storefront.

2. **Yellow Inhaler**:

   * This product is set with a **compare-at price of 119** and a **sale price of 89**, but the **discounted price is not displaying** on the live website at all.

We've already verified the product setup in the admin, and the prices are correctly configured. It seems like this could be a **theme-related issue or a frontend display glitch**.

Could you please help investigate why the correct sale and compare-at prices are not reflecting on the storefront?

Thanks in advance!

"Jun 5, 2025",57964233,Core,General,Discounts,"I have a merchant building a product bundle system with discounts applied via /cart/update.js. The discount code (BUNDLETEST) persists in the cart session even after removal attempts using /cart/update.js, /cart/clear, and cache resets across browsers and incognito mode. Any ideas on why the discount code isn't being fully removed?

Thank you for the assistance

Discount code ""BUNDLETEST"" persists in cart session despite:

/cart/clear and /cart/update.js attempts
Clearing cookies/localStorage
Using incognito/different browsers
Cache resets (4-48hr wait)
This blocks core bundle feature implementation. Tried multiple approaches (AJAX, page reloads, various cart updates) with no success.

Need to know if this is a platform limitation requiring third-party app solution, or if there's a technical fix available.

Implementing bundle discounts via theme code using /cart/update.js and /cart/add.js. Code works correctly but Shopify's cart session maintains old discount codes even when deactivated.

Current implementation:

Validates bundle products in cart
Applies/removes discount via AJAX
Uses cart attributes for state tracking
Handles all edge cases (quantity changes, removals)
Need to know if:

This is a known AJAX API limitation

Now, when attempting to reverse the store credit and issue a refund, **there’s no amount available to refund** from the order.

Would creating a **draft order** be the best approach in this case to collect payment and process a refund back to the original payment method?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Developers Response:
 It seems that the upsell offer after purchase is not going through due to an issue related to PayPal or the payment method connected to your store.

When the initial payment is entered immediately, Shopify does not allow the addition of other items to the order, which prevents the post-purchase upsell from going through.

To clarify things, ReConvert simply triggers Shopify's post-purchase API to add the item to the upsell, but payment management and order processing are entirely handled by Shopify and the payment provider (like PayPal).",Denivin Araneta,TaskUs HTW Geo Lead,Outsourced Employees (TaskUs),Zharick Mazuera,TaskUs Cali Geo Lead,Outsourced Employees (TaskUs),35,resolved live,28,78.66666666666667,true,false

Specifically, when processing an order that contained two distinct line items (a regular product and a free product with a selling plan), the webhook payload only returned a single line item with a total quantity of 3. This led to the creation of a subscription contract that did not include the free product, which was supposed to have a selling plan associated with it.

As a result, the free product was excluded from the contract and had no contract association. This issue persisted in subsequent orders, where only a single line item with a quantity of 3 was reported again, with the free product still missing.

Issue: Customers are unable to select any color options on the product page. The variants appear to be set up correctly in the backoffice, and this issue seems to be isolated to this specific product, as other products with variants are functioning properly.
Corrin has confirmed that they noticed the issue today, but it may have existed since the product was added last week. I am currently investigating on the backend and will provide updates as I gather more information.

Should this issue be escalated to TMS for further investigation since the slack thread is about refund and based on the merchant the order confirmation doesn't have an option to capture the payment? Would appreciate any insights you can share. Thanks in advance!

This is the review 
I asked for a basic feature — setting default payment terms per client. They admitted it's possible but said I’d need to upgrade to their premium plan, which is 3x more expensive. So they can do it, but they just want to charge way more for something simple. Feels like they’re forcing you to pay extra for functionality they already have, not recommended.

This is what the developer states

We believe this review is verifiably misleading. Sufio does not support assigning payment terms per client on any plan; Starter, Growth, Professional, Premium, or Plus. The functionality simply doesn’t exist in our app. Instead, we recommend using Shopify’s native payment terms feature, which works in tandem with our invoicing app.

Q: Why is the 1,000 variant per day limit a blocker for your business?

A: The 1000 variant per day limit means it would take over 82 days to upload all of the remaining products to shopify via the admin API. This goes well beyond the deadline of the 9th of June I have been set by my employer. 


Q: Why is waiting for the 24-hour period to reset not acceptable?

A: Also due to the deadline as stated above  


Q: Why is having more than 50,000 variants on your shop mandatory for your business?

A: The goal of the business is to have the full catalogue of products available for search instantly and efficiently. By having all 132000 products live and listed within the store, customers are able to find their specific product and other compatible parts. 


Q: What is the specific niche or product category of your business?

A:  The company I'm building the store for has been granted the sole licence and agreement to become the UK branch of a very large and comprehensive German filter company. They currently lead Europe in all types of filters from oil filters, carbon filters, coolant filter and so on. 


Q: Have you confirmed that you are not primarily dropshipping or using a third-party print-on-demand supplier?

A: This isn't a dropshipping company. It is the uk branch of an already well established German company. The UK store will have its own stock and will be posting the products first hand.

The merchant is experiencing a DNS issue and their domain is currently not working.
Upon investigation, I found that their DNS records were not properly set, which was causing the issue.
However, I also discovered that their account is currently frozen due to a pending bill, which is preventing the domain from functioning correctly.
The merchant purchased the domain through Shopify on April 20, 2025.

Dynamic Text Metafield (Author Tab) Not Displaying in Translated View
The “Author” tab, which uses a dynamic text metafield, isn’t appearing when the page is translated.

Any insights on these two issues would be greatly appreciated.
